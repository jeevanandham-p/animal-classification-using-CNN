# animal-classification-using-CNN
In this project, i will be exploring the Animal-10 dataset and building a deep learning model to classify images of different animals. This project is inspired by the work of Utkarsh Saxena on Kaggle, who achieved an accuracy of 93% using the ResNet152V2 model. By repeating this project, I aim to gain a better understanding of the dataset and learn how to build a robust deep learning model for image classification.
